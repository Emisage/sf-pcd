1. We present a new low-rank subspace clustering framework with prior knowledge.
2. An unsupervised learning process is designed to obtain the prior knowledge for normal estimation.
3. The anisotropic neighborhood of each candidate feature points is segmented into several isotropic subneighborhoods by the framework. 
4. A consistent subneighborhood is identified and used for accurate normal estimation.
